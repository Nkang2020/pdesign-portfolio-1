I’m Norman, a Korean-American product designer living in Cupertino, CA. I love all things animated, the outdoors and practicing martial arts. These days, you can find me reading historical non-fiction, jogging with my dog or doodling and re-imagining the world.<br/><br/>My journey began at The University of California, San Diego. There I found an interest and talent in Biochemistry. I graduated with a B.S in Biochemistry/Chemistry and worked as a Production Biochemist afterwards. My background in Biochemistry provided me with complex problem solving skills and an analytical mindset that I bring with me to all my future endeavors.<br/><br/>During my time as a Biochemist, I found a passion for web development. This is when I started learning Front-end development in my free time. I was fortunate to be able to work for PINT, inc. as a Front-end developer and technical support engineer. There I was able to hone in on technical skills and further narrow down what I truly loved to do. I found myself drawn to the design process. In particular, researching user experience to inform design decisions.<br/><br/>In 2019, I attended Carnegie Mellon University’s Master of Human-Computer Interaction program. There I met talented individuals with the same passion and developed product design skills and thinking.

Our final decision to focus on making customer support proactive rather than reactive was based on providing the greatest value for the customers and AMF Bakeries while allowing for a realistic mobile application.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"amf-flex-in flex-in-3\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20-2 sub-header\">REVERSE ASSUMPTION</span>\n                      <span className=\"bold fsize18\">Customer support is proactive rather than reactive</span>\n                      <img className=\"amf-img-1\" src={I6} />\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                  \n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">LO-FI DESIGN</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The lo-fi phase, from sketches to greyscale mockups, helped us further develop a sense of the needs of bakery managers and the data AMF would provide them.<br/><br/>While our first wireframes focused on individual screens, later iterations built out user flows and relationships between screens.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img5\" src={I7} />\n\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">MID-FI DESIGN</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">In an effort to realign the app with our priority to allow bakeries to have a more direct line to customer support, we narrowed our app’s primary focus from machine monitoring and reporting to just issue reporting. A mantra we kept in mind was ‘do one thing well’, and other successes will follow.<br/><br/>As a result, we developed a means of directly reporting an issue or filing a maintenance request from the home screen (the lower right ‘plus’ icon), as well as through the diagnostic flow.<br/><br/>For our hi-fi prototype, we planned to finalize our design by implementing a complete color scheme and micro-interactions, such as an animated loading screen, to create a stronger sense of branding.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img5\" src={I8} />\n\n                  <div className=\"amf-flex vert mtop150\">\n                    <div className=\"amf-flex-in\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20-2 sub-header\">BRAND</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">We chose a color palette that utilized AMF’s existing products with the bright red, white, and black, but fused in a more modern blue tone and choice of typography due to its connotation with safety and trust given this product’s focus on customer support.</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20-2 sub-header mtop50\">VOICE</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">We chose a color palette that utilized AMF’s existing products with the bright red, white, and black, but fused in a more modern blue tone and choice of typography due to its connotation with safety and trust given this product’s focus on customer support.</span>\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"amf-flex-in\">\n                      <img className=\"amf-img-1 shadow flex-in-3\" src={I9} />\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">MICRO-INTERACTIONS</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">Micro-interactions were added to AMFSupport to smooth transitions, add delight, and reduce cognitive load.

However, applying machine learning at scale has created friction around experiment management, thus driving the need to manage this complexity.<br/><br/>My team's goal was to design a platform for managing machine learning experiments and enhance both reproducibility and knowledge sharing to simplify the model training process, allowing for higher success rates of experiments and the delivery of increasingly sophisticated products powered by machine learning.<br/><br/>Check out the custom coded project website I developed and helped design.</span>\n            <a className=\"aremove\" href=\"https://nkang2020.github.io/bloomberg-mhci-site/\" target=\"_blank\"><button className=\"button-1\">View Project Website</button></a>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"wid45 b-fix\" src={Img2} />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n                  <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">RESEARCH</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">In order to submerge ourselves in the machine learning space, we conducted in-depth primary and secondary research before meeting up with our stakeholders at Bloomberg.

This made it easier to see which emerging patterns were most prevalent among teams. We were now able to get a preliminary sense of the shared artifacts the teams used, points of divergence for the artifacts, and the challenges they faced.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <img className=\"img3\" src={Img3} />\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                    <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">We took a deeper look into the current software Bloomberg engineers use to run Machine Learning experiments.

In order to understand our users more, we developed a participatory research method.<br/><br/>We landed on visual storytelling to create a more tangible, shared understanding of our users’ processes. Users ran through the workflow of a recent experiment while the interviewer captured and reflected feedback in real-time. We found that the ML engineers were much more engaged when actively helping us design their narratives.</span>\n                            </div>\n                            <img className=\"img6\" src={Img5} />\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                    <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">MASTER WORKFLOW</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">An indepth view of Bloomberg Machine Learning Engineer’s Master Workflow based on our findings.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <img className=\"img4\" src={Img6} />\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                    <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">INSIGHTS</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">By utilizing design thinking, we took the research we conducted and produced three main insights to ground design directions.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"div-2\">\n                            <div className=\"div-2-inside\">\n                                <span className=\"insight-bloom\">INSIGHT 01</span>\n                                <span className=\"insight-bloom-2\">Ineffective tracking leads to further issues in documentation and discoverability.</span>\n                                <span className=\"insight-bloom-3\">A lack of tracking support leaves engineer’s to their own devices when deciding which artifacts to track and subsequently the tools used for creating documentation.

It is different than that of a prototype in its ability to test ideas and their market potential cheaply and easily.<br/><br/>Instead of answering questions such as, can we build it? or will it work as expected?,  a pretotype focuses on answering core need questions such as should we build it at all? Or if we build it, will people buy it and use it? We developed 4 components of the pretotype.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <img className=\"img3 noshadow\" src={Img10} />\n\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">After coming up with a list of most valuable pain points to target and the features that would do so, we built off the pretotype by deciding a direction developing an all-in-one machine learning management platform to address tracking, documentation and discoverability issues. Before delving into features, we worked on the information architecture. We iterated over this using tree testing with users to match their mental models with the information architecture.</span>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <img className=\"img5\" src={Img11} />\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">MID-FI SCREENS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">After nailing down the information architecture, we created mid-fidelity screens demonstrating various pages’ functions. The Homepage is a hub of the engineers’ projects. The documentation page documents each project’s process from goals to experiments. The runs page is a collection of all the engineers’ runs, and from there, engineers are able to graph them on a runs visualize page.</span>\n                      <img className=\"img5\" src={Img12} />\n                            </div>\n                            <img className=\"img6 img6fix h100\" src={Img13} />\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">USABILITY TESTING</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">Our target user (ML engineers) consists of many types– ranging from new team members to team leads. We have identified the four primary user types for our solution, and the goal of this usability test is to have each of these types complete a task specific to their needs. Through this, we hope to understand how effectively the user is able to navigate through various flows by measuring both time and overall comprehension.</span>\n                      \n                            </div>\n                            <img className=\"img6 h100\" src={Img14} />\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">DESIGN SYSTEMS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">We created a design systems to cohesively tie together various components of our product, such as color, typeface, icons, grids, buttons, form fields, menus, and etc. Since we are creating a solution for our client Bloomberg, we wanted to make sure the design aesthetic aligns with Bloomberg’s branding. We took Bloomberg’s current web design systems and incorporated our design of various components based on the established color and typography.</span>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <img className=\"img5\" src={Img15} />\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">HI-FI SCREENS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">The push from mid-fidelity to high-fidelity screens were done in iterations based on the usability testing and group discussions. When designing these screens, we considered how the user would best accomplish the main use cases. Also, details such as blank and maximum states were designed for ensure the screens were robust. Each screen had interactions which can be seen in our demo video at the end of the page.</span>\n                      <img className=\"img5\" src={Img16} />\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"morewidy\">\n                            <img className=\"img7\" src={Img17} />\n                            </div>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">DEMO VIDEO</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The demo video shows Nathan, a Machine Learning engineer use Trace to accomplish four main uses cases, to make tracking, comparing, documenting and discovering work more easy.</span>\n        </div>\n        <video className=\"img5\" controls>\n                <source src={Tracevid} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            </video>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class=\"maxw\">\n        <Footer />\n        </div>\n        \n      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nexport default Bloomberg;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/bloomberg.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport NavBar from './navbar3/nav3';\nimport './diagnomics.css';\nimport D1 from './images/wd-diagnomics.png';\nimport D2 from './images/diagnomics-macbook.png';\nimport C1 from './images/working-covid.png';\nimport C2 from './images/geno-final-min.png';\nimport C3 from './images/UXPersona.png';\nimport C4 from './images/ia-genomatch.png';\nimport C5 from './images/website-genomatch-2.png';\nimport C6 from './images/mvp-genomatch.png';\nimport C7 from './images/learn3.png';\nimport C8 from './images/order2.png';\nimport C9 from './images/activate2.png';\nimport C10 from './images/track2.png';\nimport C11 from './images/results1.png';\nimport Footer from './footer/footer';\nimport ProjectStart from './project-start/project-start';\nimport ProjectBoxes from './project-boxes/project-boxes';\n\n\n\n\nclass Diagnomics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"slang-body\"> \n      <div className=\"App-slang\">\n        <NavBar />\n        <ProjectStart desc=\"Blank\" img={D1}/>\n        <ProjectBoxes info={\"Designing a COVID-19 and Genetic testing subscription platform.\"} duration={\"August 2020 - Present\"} role={\"UX/UI Designer\"} team={\"Kira Lee - Project Manager\"}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"covid-div\">\n        <div className=\"slang-div-2-bloom\"> \n          <div className=\"flex-slang\">\n          <div class=\"wid45 bloom-divy\">\n            <span className=\"slang-head-1 bb\">INTRODUCING A COVID-19 TESTING PLATFORM TO AN EXISTING GENETIC TESTING SOLUTION</span>\n            {/* <span className=\"text-1 bb\"><b>Problem statement:</b></span><br/><br/> */}\n            <span className=\"text-1 bb\">Genomatch is an existing genetic testing solution that allows users to test their genes and get specialized reports and treatment plans.

This is a complex task as each employee must be tested and monitored regularly. We planned to utilize Genomatch’s existing infrastructure to deliver and report test results. On top of that, we needed new flows that were highly efficient for users to order, retrieve and and see results on a regular basis.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img3\" src={C1} />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">HI-FI USER FLOW</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">These are high fidelity screens and flows that I designed to solve the problem of getting employees and subscribers regular Covid-19 testing kits and results while also providing genetic testing services.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img3\" src={C2} />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">MVP</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">Getting a product out as soon as possible was essential for Genomatch as COVID-19 concerns would eventually go away and therefore the product’s profit window had a shelf life. Because of this, I took the original site/platform and designed a Minimum Viable Product to release a product to existing customers as soon as possible. This was done at an agile pace and took into account current state, development viability, costs and time.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img3\" src={C6} />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">EXPLORATION</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">With the MVP allowing customers to start purchasing COVID-19 testing subscription, I set out to improve the experience. I conducted competitive research to understand trends and best practices in the space of genetic and covid testing. I also explored secondary domains such as Jira, Trello, and other platforms to better understand how industry leaders onboard users. I made an effort to look outside the box for inspiration. By gaining inspiration and understanding what was working well and how our product differed from the competition, I was able to position genomatch better.</span>\n                  </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">THE USER</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">A large part of my design process is to understand the user’s perspective. For this project, we have two main user groups with each having a different goal. This posed an interesting challenge for us. Our solution needed to sell to employers, and provide service to the employee. I used personas to align my design process with user goals and better empathize with users. Below is a persona of an employee subscriber.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"persona\" src={C3} />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">Before jumping into design, I wanted to understand the current system at a high level and then imagine how I could include covid-19 testing features and ways to improve the user flows. From this method, I was able to reduce redundant flows for the final designs.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img3\" src={C4} />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">RESPONSIVE WEBSITE REDESIGN</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The project consisted of two parts: the website and the member portal. Our first point of contact with the user is via the website. I redesigned the website to include COVID-19 products and to educate the customer on our value props and how easy to use our service actually is. While designing the website, my goal was to ultimately build a simple path for customer success. The flow I designed was to educate users, compare with competitors, answer questions, then sell. The website redesign looks like this:</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"img3\" src={C5} />\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">FLOWS</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">Despite government regulations and health complexities, the experience to learn, obtain, track and get results needed to be seamless. The design addresses this by making it viscerally clear what options there are, what the next steps are, and where the user is in the process.

Slanguage won the ‘Most Original’ prize. After the competition, I developed Slanguage into a working chrome extension using Javascript.<br/><br/>The end product scans websites for pre-determined slang phrases and adds them into an inbox which the user can choose to save or clear.</span>\n          </div>\n            \n            <video className=\"group-pic\" controls>\n                <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            </video>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hider\">\n                <div className=\"tab-bar\">\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab tablink active-1\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'London')}><span className=\"tab-text\">01</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">IDEATION</span></button>\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab shift-tab tablink\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'Paris')}><span className=\"tab-text\">02</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">RESEARCH</span></button>\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab shift-tab tablink\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'Tokyo')}><span className=\"tab-text\">03</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">INSIGHTS</span></button>\n                  </div>\n                <div className=\"tab-box tabby\" id=\"London\">\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">Due to the short time span on Rehack, our team had to ideate a solution quickly. Our task was to use technology to create more meaningful and productive interactions in society. As a group, we brainstormed issues that divide society. We honed in on how different languages and cultures create barriers for interactions. Our team focused on designing a live translation system. We understood that there were many existing solutions for translations, such as Google Translate, so we looked at the problem from different perspectives.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">An interesting perspective we found was that of a young foreigner coming to America who learned to speak english in a foreign country. The challenges this individual faced revealed unique pain points.<br/><br/>Many foreigners learn english before arriving to America, but they do not learn slang or colloquial speech. We found that this process occurs slowly during a transitional period. The idea for Slanguage was set, the next phase was to research the value provided and which features to incorporate.</span>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"tab-box disnone tabby\" id=\"Paris\">\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">Ideally, the research phase of a project is a lengthy process of data gathering and analysis. Because of the nature of hackathons, we had a short time limit on the amount of research that could be done.

Our task was to use technology to create more meaningful and productive interactions in society. As a group, we brainstormed issues that divide society. We honed in on how different languages and cultures create barriers for interactions. Ben Stone proposed a we design a live translation system. We understood that there were many existing solutions for translations, such as Google Translate, so we looked at the problem from different perspectives.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">An interesting perspective we found was that of a young foreigner coming to America who learned to speak english in a foreign country. The challenges this individual faced revealed unique pain points.<br/><br/>Many foreigners learn english before arriving to America, but they do not learn slang or colloquial speech. We found that this process occurs slowly during a transitional period. The idea for Slanguage was set, the next phase was to research the value provided and which features to incorporate.</span>\n                    </div>\n                  \n                    <div className=\"dota-div mbot25 mtop50\"><span className=\"tab-text\">02</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">RESEARCH</span></div>\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">Ideally, the research phase of a project is a lengthy process of data gathering and analysis.

Our solution is geared towards young adults so we wanted to keep the tone fun and novel by using bright tones but also keep a trustworthy feel by using solid design principles and colors. Furthermore, the nature of slang is fun and young while the translation aspect needs to represent quality and trust. This duality informed our logo design and more. We utilized moodboards to inspire a style guide and the feel of the product that is playful yet reliable.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        {/* <div className=\"pic-compare-div\">\n                            <p className=\"box-header\">MOBILE FEATURE</p>\n                            <span class=\"text-p lh23\">Our proposed solution is to include a sister phone application which connects to the translation inbox of the computer and the phone. With this, we would include group mode, which when activated sends live notifications to the phone.<br/><br/>This would allow users to receive live translation notifications discreetly while watching netflix or youtube with others.</span>\n                        </div> */}\n                        <img className=\"img-3\" src={Branding} />\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"flex-div mtop150\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">DESKTOP FEATURE</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The main feature of Slanguage is a desktop chrome extension. Web pages, applications or videos are actively scanned for slang words and the translation is added to an inbox for the user to check at their convenience.

To begin with, during the research phase, more generative research could be accomplished by conducting semi-structured interviews of foreigners who moved to the US. These data points would be analyzed using affinity mapping to uncover hidden problem spaces and user sentiments. Finally, it would be beneficial to conduct concept validation using storyboards with users to understand how our mental models align with the user mental models. These tasks would allow us to better understand the user and justify design decisions and uncover more useful potential features.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  \n                    </div> */}\n                    <p className=\"motto\">\"For the first time, <b><i>you don't need to ask to be in the know</i></b>\"</p>\n                    <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150 mobile-fix\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2\">DEVELOPMENT</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">After the hackathon, I decided to develop Slanguage into a working chrome extension as a personal project. I used Javascript to build Slanguage. Whenever I start a development project, I break the project down into logic pieces. The first step was to use Javascript to scan the current webpage for predetermined slang words or phrases. Once the program detects slang, it would populate the extension inbox with the data. This must also trigger a notification to the user.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"develop-div\">\n                  \n                      \n                      <div className=\"\">\n                      <p className=\"halfwid fsize20 lh23 mid-text tcenter\">Code Logic Diagram</p>\n                      <img className=\"img-6\" src={Logic} />\n                      \n                      </div>\n\n                  <div className=\"flex-slang-2 mtop120\">\n                      <span className=\"halfwid lh23\">As the inbox populates, the data needed to be stored. In order to store the data, I utilized the browser local storage. There the data of the encountered slang phrases is collected. The user can dismiss encountered words in the inbox but the data persists in the local storage so as to not repopulate the same slang. The logic that made this possible was to create a seperate viewing bank so that it would only display slang that the user had not dismissed.<br/><br/>The overall process of developing Slanguage was extremely rewarding. It was great to come full circle and see our project completed and usable! I aim to place it in the google store for free in hopes to help others learn Slang!</span>\n                      <video className=\"group-pic\" controls>\n                      <source src={Vid2} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n                  </video>\n                  </div>\n                  </div>\n        <div class=\"maxw\">\n        <Footer />\n        </div>\n      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nexport default Slanguage;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/slanguage.js","import React from \"react\";\nimport Slider from \"react-slick\";\nimport Slide1 from './images/domain1.png';\nimport Slide2 from './images/domain2.png';\nimport Slide3 from './images/domain3.png';\nimport Slide4 from './images/domain4.png';\nimport Slide5 from './images/domain5.png';\n \nclass SimpleSlider extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    };\n    return (\n      <Slider {...settings}>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide1} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide2} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide3} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide4} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide5} />\n        </div>\n      </Slider>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SimpleSlider;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/slider.js","import React from \"react\";\nimport Slider from \"react-slick\";\nimport Slide1 from './images/storyboard1.png';\nimport Slide2 from './images/storyboard2.png';\nimport Slide3 from './images/storyboard3.png';\n \nclass SimpleSlider2 extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    var settings = {\n      dots: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1\n    };\n    return (\n      <Slider {...settings}>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide1} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide2} />\n        </div>\n        <div>\n        <img className=\"slides shadow\" src={Slide3} />\n        </div>\n      </Slider>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SimpleSlider2;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/slider2.js","var QueryHandler = require('./QueryHandler');\nvar each = require('./Util').each;\n\n/**\n * Represents a single media query, manages it's state and registered handlers for this query\n *\n * @constructor\n * @param {string} query the media query string\n * @param {boolean} [isUnconditional=false] whether the media query should run regardless of whether the conditions are met.
