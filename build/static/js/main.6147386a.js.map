I’m Norman, a Korean-American product designer living in Cupertino, CA. I love all things animated, the outdoors and practicing martial arts. These days, you can find me reading historical non-fiction, jogging with my dog or doodling and re-imagining the world.<br/><br/>My journey began at The University of California, San Diego. There I found an interest and talent in Biochemistry. I graduated with a B.S in Biochemistry/Chemistry and worked as a Production Biochemist afterwards. My background in Biochemistry provided me with complex problem solving skills and an analytical mindset that I bring with me to all my future endeavors.<br/><br/>During my time as a Biochemist, I found a passion for web development. This is when I started learning Front-end development in my free time. I was fortunate to be able to work for PINT, inc. as a Front-end developer and technical support engineer. There I was able to hone in on technical skills and further narrow down what I truly loved to do. I found myself drawn to the design process. In particular, researching user experience to inform design decisions.<br/><br/>In 2019, I was accepted into Carnegie Mellon University’s Master of Human-Computer Interaction program. There I would meet talented individuals with the same passion and develop product design skills and thinking. Currently, I am working on the MHCI Capstone project with Bloomberg to design a Machine Learning platform to better manage experiments.</p>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <Footer />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/about.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport NavBar from './navbar3/nav3';\nimport './amf.css';\nimport I1 from './images/amf1.png';\nimport I2 from './images/amf2.png';\nimport I3 from './images/amf3.png';\nimport I4 from './images/amf4.svg';\nimport I5 from './images/amf5.svg';\nimport I6 from './images/amf6.jpeg';\nimport I7 from './images/amf7.png';\nimport I8 from './images/amf8.png';\nimport I9 from './images/amf9.png';\nimport Footer from './footer/footer';\nimport ProjectStart from './project-start/project-start';\nimport ProjectBoxes from './project-boxes/project-boxes';\n\n\n\n\nclass Amf extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"slang-body\"> \n      <div className=\"App-slang\">\n        <NavBar />\n        <ProjectStart desc=\"Blank\" img={I1}/>\n        <ProjectBoxes info={\"A solution to enhance the service capabilities of Markel Food Group.\"} duration={\"October 2019 - November 2019\"} role={\"Product Designer\"} team={\"Bennett Huffman - Designer \\n Katie Johnstone - Designer \\n June Kim - Designer\"}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"yellow-div-3\">\n        <div className=\"slang-div-2-bloom\">\n          \n          <div className=\"flex-slang\">\n          <div class=\"wid45 bloom-divy\">\n            <span className=\"slang-head-1 bb\">A NATIVE APPLICATION FOR MACHINE MONITORING AND ISSUE REPORTING</span>\n            <span className=\"text-1 bb\">Our team was tasked with creating a native mobile application to enhance the service capabilities of Markel Food Group. The application needed to fit with the business’ current offering and harness the capabilities of a mobile phone.<br/><br/>We designed AMFSupport.

Machine learning is being applied to nearly every facet of the business – from data acquisition to real-time news alerts and story generation. However, applying machine learning at scale has created friction around experiment management, thus driving the need to manage this complexity.<br/><br/>My team's goal was to design a platform for managing machine learning experiments and enhance both reproducibility and knowledge sharing to simplify the model training process, allowing for higher success rates of experiments and the delivery of increasingly sophisticated products powered by machine learning.<br/><br/>Check out the custom coded project website I developed and helped design.</span>\n            <a className=\"aremove\" href=\"https://nkang2020.github.io/bloomberg-mhci-site/\" target=\"_blank\"><button className=\"button-1\">View Project Website</button></a>\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"wid45 b-fix\" src={Img2} />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n                  <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">RESEARCH</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">In order to submerge ourselves in the machine learning space, we conducted in-depth primary and secondary research before meeting up with our stakeholders at Bloomberg.

We created storyboards to outline some of those initial directions.

It is different than that of a prototype in its ability to test ideas and their market potential cheaply and easily.<br/><br/>Instead of answering questions such as, can we build it? or will it work as expected?,  a pretotype focuses on answering core need questions such as should we build it at all? Or if we build it, will people buy it and use it? We developed 4 components of the pretotype.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <img className=\"img3 noshadow\" src={Img10} />\n\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">After coming up with a list of most valuable pain points to target and the features that would do so, we built off the pretotype by deciding a direction developing an all-in-one machine learning management platform to address tracking, documentation and discoverability issues. Before delving into features, we worked on the information architecture. We iterated over this using tree testing with users to match their mental models with the information architecture.</span>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <img className=\"img5\" src={Img11} />\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">MID-FI SCREENS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">After nailing down the information architecture, we created mid-fidelity screens demonstrating various pages’ functions. The Homepage is a hub of the engineers’ projects. The documentation page documents each project’s process from goals to experiments. The runs page is a collection of all the engineers’ runs, and from there, engineers are able to graph them on a runs visualize page.</span>\n                      <img className=\"img5\" src={Img12} />\n                            </div>\n                            <img className=\"img6 img6fix h100\" src={Img13} />\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">USABILITY TESTING</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">Our target user (ML engineers) consists of many types– ranging from new team members to team leads. We have identified the four primary user types for our solution, and the goal of this usability test is to have each of these types complete a task specific to their needs. Through this, we hope to understand how effectively the user is able to navigate through various flows by measuring both time and overall comprehension.</span>\n                      \n                            </div>\n                            <img className=\"img6 h100\" src={Img14} />\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                      <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">DESIGN SYSTEMS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">We created a design systems to cohesively tie together various components of our product, such as color, typeface, icons, grids, buttons, form fields, menus, and etc. Since we are creating a solution for our client Bloomberg, we wanted to make sure the design aesthetic aligns with Bloomberg’s branding. We took Bloomberg’s current web design systems and incorporated our design of various components based on the established color and typography.</span>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <img className=\"img5\" src={Img15} />\n\n                        <div class=\"flex-div mtop150 screenfix\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                        <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">HI-FI SCREENS</span>\n                      <span className=\"lh23\">The push from mid-fidelity to high-fidelity screens were done in iterations based on the usability testing and group discussions. When designing these screens, we considered how the user would best accomplish the main use cases. Also, details such as blank and maximum states were designed for ensure the screens were robust. Each screen had interactions which can be seen in our demo video at the end of the page.</span>\n                      <img className=\"img5\" src={Img16} />\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"morewidy\">\n                            <img className=\"img7\" src={Img17} />\n                            </div>\n                            \n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">DEMO VIDEO</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The demo video shows Nathan, a Machine Learning engineer use Trace to accomplish four main uses cases, to make tracking, comparing, documenting and discovering work more easy.</span>\n        </div>\n        <video className=\"img5\" controls>\n                <source src={Tracevid} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            </video>\n                  </div>\n                  <div class=\"maxw\">\n        <Footer />\n        </div>\n        \n      \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nexport default Bloomberg;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/bloomberg.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport NavBar from './navbar/nav';\nimport './home.css';\nimport Projects from './projects/projects';\nimport Footer from './footer/footer'\nimport Arrow from './images/arrow-sm.gif';\nimport Wdslang from './images/wd-slangy.png';\nimport Wdbloom from './images/wd-bloomineers.png';\nimport Wdninja from './images/wd-ninja.png';\nimport Wdcali from './images/wdcali.png';\nimport Wdavalyn from './images/wdavalyn.png';\nimport Wdgot from './images/wdgot2.png';\n\nclass Home extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <div className=\"App-header\">\n        <NavBar />\n        <div className=\"vhdiv\">\n          <h2 className=\"intro\">HOLA!

After the competition, I developed Slanguage into a working chrome extension using Javascript.<br/><br/>The end product scans websites for pre-determined slang phrases and adds them into an inbox which the user can choose to save or clear.</span>\n          </div>\n            \n            <video className=\"group-pic\" controls>\n                <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n            </video>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hider\">\n                <div className=\"tab-bar\">\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab tablink active-1\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'London')}><span className=\"tab-text\">01</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">IDEATION</span></button>\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab shift-tab tablink\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'Paris')}><span className=\"tab-text\">02</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">RESEARCH</span></button>\n                    <button className=\"sub-tab shift-tab tablink\" onClick={() => this.openCity(event,'Tokyo')}><span className=\"tab-text\">03</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">INSIGHTS</span></button>\n                  </div>\n                <div className=\"tab-box tabby\" id=\"London\">\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">Due to the short time span on Rehack, our team had to ideate a solution quickly. Our task was to use technology to create more meaningful and productive interactions in society. As a group, we brainstormed issues that divide society. We honed in on how different languages and cultures create barriers for interactions. Our team focused on designing a live translation system. We understood that there were many existing solutions for translations, such as Google Translate, so we looked at the problem from different perspectives.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\">An interesting perspective we found was that of a young foreigner coming to America who learned to speak english in a foreign country. The challenges this individual faced revealed unique pain points.<br/><br/>Many foreigners learn english before arriving to America, but they do not learn slang or colloquial speech.

This research produced insights which later informed our design decisions.

We positioned Slanguage to solve issues for foreigners transitioning to American culture.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"inside-tab mtop25\">\n                        <span className=\"tabby-text lh23 tab-header\">Quotes that stood out:<br/><br/></span>\n                        <div className=\"flex\">\n                            <div className=\"wid-15\">\n                                <span className=\"li-1-1\">i</span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\"><span>\"Why don’t they teach slang in my English class?\"</span></span>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div className=\"flex\">\n                            <div className=\"wid-15\">\n                                <span className=\"li-1-1\">ii</span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\"><span>“I feel left out.”</span></span>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div className=\"flex\">\n                            <div className=\"wid-15\">\n                                <span className=\"li-1-1\">iii</span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\"><span>“I hate asking for the meaning of slang or further clarification”</span></span>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div className=\"flex\">\n                            <div className=\"wid-15\">\n                                <span className=\"li-1-1\">iv</span>\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                <span className=\"tabby-text lh23\"><span>“I feel stupid when I don’t get a joke because of the slang.”</span></span>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                  \n                    <div className=\"dota-div mtop50\"><span className=\"tab-text\">03</span><span className=\"tab-text-2\">INSIGHTS</span></div>\n                    <div class=\"goal-main-div mtop25\">\n                    <div class=\"goal-outter\">\n                            <div className=\"goal-number-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-number\">01</span>     \n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"goal-text-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-title lh23\">There is a gap between English taught in classes and English used in informal settings.</span>\n                            </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"goal-outter\">\n                            <div className=\"goal-number-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-number\">02</span>     \n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"goal-text-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-title lh23\">Slang or colloquial language is learned by asking others.</span>\n                            </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"goal-outter\">\n                            <div className=\"goal-number-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-number\">03</span>     \n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"goal-text-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-title lh23\">People feel isolated or stupid when they miss a joke due to not understanding slang.</span>\n                            </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"goal-outter2\">\n                            <div className=\"goal-number-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-number\">04</span>     \n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"goal-text-div\">\n                                <span className=\"goal-title lh23\">People do not like to pause the conversation to ask for definitions or clarification, especially in group settings.</span>\n                            </div>\n                    </div>  \n                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                  \n                  <div className=\"yellow-bar\"></div>\n                  <div className=\"design-div\">\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2 fix-m\">DESIGN</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">With the idea and insights formed, we moved on to determine the features that Slanguage would provide.

We developed a persona around Armin to understand user needs and justify design decisions.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <img className=\"persona\" src={Persona} />\n                  <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150\">\n                  <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">CURRENT / FUTURE STATE ANALYSIS</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">To further empathize with our users, we used future state analysis to understand the current user’s environment and pain points. We imagined a situation where ‘Armin’ is watching American media with friends and a slang phrase is used.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"flex-slang\">\n                      <div>\n                      <p className=\"random-head\">Current State</p>\n                          <img className=\"img-4\" src={Current} />\n                        <p className=\"card-text lh23\">Armin feels left out and confused when watching American media with friends.</p>\n                      </div>\n                      <div>\n                      <p className=\"random-head\">Future State</p>\n                          <img className=\"img-4\" src={Future} />\n                        <p className=\"card-text lh23\">With Slanguage, Armin gets live translations and can enjoy American media with friends.</p>\n                      </div>\n                  </div>\n\n\n                  <div class=\"flex-div mtop150\">\n                    <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                    <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">VISUAL DESIGN</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">After we determined the pain points and our proposed design solutions, we were ready to discuss the foundational elements of visual design. Our solution is geared towards young adults so we wanted to keep the tone fun and novel by using bright tones but also keep a trustworthy feel by using solid design principles and colors. Furthermore, the nature of slang is fun and young while the translation aspect needs to represent quality and trust. This duality informed our logo design and more. We utilized moodboards to inspire a style guide and the feel of the product that is playful yet reliable.</span>\n                        </div>\n                        {/* <div className=\"pic-compare-div\">\n                            <p className=\"box-header\">MOBILE FEATURE</p>\n                            <span class=\"text-p lh23\">Our proposed solution is to include a sister phone application which connects to the translation inbox of the computer and the phone. With this, we would include group mode, which when activated sends live notifications to the phone.<br/><br/>This would allow users to receive live translation notifications discreetly while watching netflix or youtube with others.</span>\n                        </div> */}\n                        <img className=\"img-3\" src={Branding} />\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"flex-div mtop150\">\n                        <div className=\"morewid mauto\">\n                  <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">DESKTOP FEATURE</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">The main feature of Slanguage is a desktop chrome extension. Web pages, applications or videos are actively scanned for slang words and the translation is added to an inbox for the user to check at their convenience. Translations can then be starred or dismissed. Users can also opt for live translation notifications to appear on the top right screen.</span>\n                  </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <img className=\"img-2\" src={Desktop} />\n                    <p className=\"halfwid fsize20 lh23 mid-text italic\">How might we provide foreigners with live slang translations without disrupting the experience for others?</p>\n                    <div class=\"flex-div mtop40\">\n                        <span className=\"morewid mauto lh23\">American tv shows and movies contain a lot of slang language, making watching it a difficult experience for foreigners especially when with friends because they must either stop the flow of the video and ask for the translation or feel left out and confused. Furthermore, our base solution of providing live notifications to the computer may detract from others’ viewing experience.</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"flex-div mtop150\">\n                    <div className=\"morewid2\">\n                    <span className=\"lh23 fsize20 sub-header\">MOBILE FEATURE</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">Our design solution is to include a sister phone application which connects to the translation inbox of the computer and the phone.

To begin with, during the research phase, more generative research could be accomplished by conducting semi-structured interviews of foreigners who moved to the US. These data points would be analyzed using affinity mapping to uncover hidden problem spaces and user sentiments. Finally, it would be beneficial to conduct concept validation using storyboards with users to understand how our mental models align with the user mental models. These tasks would allow us to better understand the user and justify design decisions and uncover more useful potential features.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  \n                    </div> */}\n                    <p className=\"motto\">\"For the first time, <b><i>you don't need to ask to be in the know</i></b>\"</p>\n                    <div className=\"morewid mauto mtop150 mobile-fix\">\n                  <span className=\"slang-head-2\">DEVELOPMENT</span>\n                  <span className=\"lh23\">After the hackathon, I decided to develop Slanguage into a working chrome extension as a personal project. I used Javascript to build Slanguage. Whenever I start a development project, I break the project down into logic pieces. The first step was to use Javascript to scan the current webpage for predetermined slang words or phrases. Once the program detects slang, it would populate the extension inbox with the data. This must also trigger a notification to the user.</span>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"develop-div\">\n                  \n                      \n                      <div className=\"\">\n                      <p className=\"halfwid fsize20 lh23 mid-text tcenter\">Code Logic Diagram</p>\n                      <img className=\"img-6\" src={Logic} />\n                      \n                      </div>\n\n                  <div className=\"flex-slang-2 mtop120\">\n                      <span className=\"halfwid lh23\">As the inbox populates, the data needed to be stored. In order to store the data, I utilized the browser local storage. There the data of the encountered slang phrases is collected. The user can dismiss encountered words in the inbox but the data persists in the local storage so as to not repopulate the same slang. The logic that made this possible was to create a seperate viewing bank so that it would only display slang that the user had not dismissed.<br/><br/>The overall process of developing Slanguage was extremely rewarding.
